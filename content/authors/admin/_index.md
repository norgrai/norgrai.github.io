  - title: Enriching Way√∫unaiki‚ÄìSpanish Neural Machine Translation with Linguistic Information
    url: https://aclanthology.org/2023.americasnlp-1.9
    date: '2023-07-01'
    awarder: Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AmericasNLP)
    authors:
      - Graichen, Nora 
      - van Genabith, Josef 
      - Espa√±a-Bonet, Cristina
    topic: Proceedings of the Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Indigenous Languages of the Americas (AmericasNLP)
    summary: |
      We present the first neural machine translation system for the low-resource language pair Way√∫unaiki‚ÄìSpanish and explore strategies to inject linguistic knowledge into the model to improve translation quality. We explore a wide range of methods and combine complementary approaches. Results indicate that incorporating linguistic information through linguistically motivated subword segmentation, factored models, and pretrained embeddings helps the system to generate improved translations, with the segmentation contributing most. In order to evaluate translation quality in a general domain and go beyond the available religious domain data, we gather and make publicly available a new test set and supplementary material. Although translation quality as measured with automatic metrics is low, we hope these resources will facilitate and support further research on Way√∫unaiki.
  - title: Not a nuisance but a useful heuristic: Outlier dimensions favor frequent tokens in language models
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21718
    date: '2025-03-27'
    awarder: Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the 8th BlackboxNLP Workshop
    authors:
      - Macocco, Iuri 
      - Graichen, Nora 
      - Boleda, Gemma 
      - Baroni, Marco
    topic: Proceedings of the 8th BlackboxNLP Workshop (Co-located with EMNLP 2025)
    summary: |
      We study last-layer outlier dimensions, i.e. dimensions that display extreme activations for the majority of inputs. We show that outlier dimensions arise in many different modern language models, and trace their function back to the heuristic of constantly predicting frequent words. We further show how a model can block this heuristic when it is not contextually appropriate, by assigning a counterbalancing weight mass to the remaining dimensions, and we investigate which model parameters boost outlier dimensions and when they arise during training. We conclude that outlier dimensions are a specialized mechanism discovered by many distinct models to implement a useful token prediction heuristic.
